When I was getting married, I wanted to wear a suit that was both traditional and modern. I didn't want to go for the typical black or navy blue suit that most grooms wear.

For footwear, I went with a pair of brown leather shoes that completed the look.</p><p><h2>Types of Wedding Suits for Men in India</h2></p><p>When it comes to mens wedding suits ideas India, there are many different types of suits that you can choose from.
