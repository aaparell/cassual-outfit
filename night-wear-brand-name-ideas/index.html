The Classic NameOne approach to naming your night wear brand is to go with a classic name. A classic name is one that has been around for a long time and is instantly recognizable. These names are often associated with quality, reliability, and tradition. For example, Victoria&#39;s Secret is a classic name that has been around for decades and is instantly recognizable.
