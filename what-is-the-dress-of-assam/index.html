One of the most significant aspects of Assamese culture is their traditional clothing. If you're wondering what is the dress of Assam, you've come to the right place.

The traditional dress of Assam differs from one community to another. However, the most popular and widely worn traditional attire in Assam is the Mekhela Chador for women and the Dhoti-Kurta or Gamosa for men. These dresses are not just a piece of clothing but hold immense cultural and emotional significance for the people of Assam.</p><p>The Mekhela Chador is a two-piece garment that comprises of a long skirt and a shawl-like upper garment. The skirt, known as the Mekhela, is worn around the waist and pleated at the front. The Chador, on the other hand, is draped over the shoulder and tucked on one side of the waist. The Mekhela Chador is usually made of silk or cotton and is adorned with intricate designs and patterns.</p><p>The Dhoti-Kurta is the traditional attire for men in Assam. The Dhoti is a rectangular piece of cloth worn around the waist and between the legs, while the Kurta is a long shirt that covers the upper body. The Gamosa, on the other hand, is a rectangular piece of cloth that is used as a towel, headgear, or scarf by both men and women. It is a symbol of Assamese pride and culture and is often gifted to guests as a token of respect and hospitality.</p><h2>My Personal Experience with Assamese Traditional Clothing</h2><p>As an Assamese myself, I have grown up wearing the Mekhela Chador on special occasions and festivals.

The silk or cotton yarn is first dyed using natural dyes, and then the weaver prepares the loom for weaving.
