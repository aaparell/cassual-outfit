Some of these factors include:</p><p><h3>Brand</h3></p><p>The brand of a watch can have a big impact on the price. Luxury brands such as Rolex and Omega tend to have higher price points than more affordable brands such as Timex and Casio. However, keep in mind that just because a watch is expensive does not necessarily mean it is better quality.</p><p><h3>Materials</h3></p><p>The materials used in a watch can also affect the price.

Additionally, watches with higher quality materials such as sapphire crystal are often more expensive.</p><p><h3>Features</h3></p><p>The features available on a watch can also impact the price. Watches with more features such as chronographs or complications will generally be more expensive than those with basic features such as time and date.</p><p><h3>Market Demand</h3></p><p>The demand for a particular watch can also affect its price.
