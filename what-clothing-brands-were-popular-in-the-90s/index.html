The brand's provocative advertising campaigns featuring models like Kate Moss and Mark Wahlberg caused controversy and made headlines. However, it was the brand's minimalist style and high-quality fabrics that really made it stand out. Calvin Klein's underwear collection became a must-have for both men and women in the decade, and the brand's jeans and fragrances were also hugely popular.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: Why were these brands so popular in the 90s?</p><p>A: These brands were popular in the 90s because they represented the changing tastes of consumers.
