It's a fascinating topic that captures the attention of sports fans and collectors alike. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual observer, the world of sports memorabilia is full of interesting stories and incredible prices.</p><p>For many people, sports memorabilia is a way to connect with their favorite athletes and teams. Whether it's a signed jersey, a game-used ball, or a piece of equipment, these items can hold a special place in a collector's heart. However, the world of sports memorabilia is also full of scams, fakes, and inflated prices, which can make it difficult for collectors to navigate.</p><p>The most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold is a baseball card: the 1909-1911 T206 Honus Wagner card. This card was sold for a record-breaking $3.12 million in 2016, breaking the previous record of $2.8 million set in 2007. The card is considered to be one of the most valuable in the world due to its rarity, condition, and the story behind it.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a closer look at the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold, as well as some other notable items that have sold for high prices. We'll also explore the world of sports memorabilia collecting, including tips for beginners and some common pitfalls to avoid.</p><h2>What Makes the T206 Honus Wagner Card So Valuable?</h2><p>The T206 Honus Wagner card is considered to be the "holy grail" of baseball cards. It was produced between 1909 and 1911 by the American Tobacco Company and features Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Honus Wagner. However, the card was pulled from circulation early on, for reasons that are still unclear. Some say that Wagner was unhappy with being featured on a tobacco product, while others speculate that he wanted more money for the use of his image.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the T206 Honus Wagner card is incredibly rare. Only around 60-200 cards are believed to exist, and most of them are in poor condition. The card that sold for $3.12 million in 2016 is one of the highest-quality examples in existence, with a grade of PSA 5 (out of 10). It was also owned by hockey legend Wayne Gretzky at one point, which adds to its mystique.</p><h2>Other Notable Expensive Sports Memorabilia</h2><p>While the T206 Honus Wagner card is the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold, there are plenty of other items that have sold for high prices. Here are a few notable examples:</p><ul><li>The "Babe Ruth Jersey": In 2012, a New York Yankees jersey worn by Babe Ruth sold for $4.4 million, making it the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia at the time. However, some experts have since cast doubt on the authenticity of the jersey.</li><li>Mark McGwire's 70th Home Run Ball: In 1998, Mark McGwire hit 70 home runs in a single season, breaking Roger Maris's record. The ball he hit for his 70th homer sold for $3 million in 1999.</li><li>Muhammad Ali's Gloves: Muhammad Ali's gloves from his 1965 fight against Sonny Liston sold for $836,500 in 2011.</li></ul><h3>The World of Sports Memorabilia Collecting</h3><p>If you're interested in collecting sports memorabilia, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, do your research. Make sure you're buying from a reputable dealer, and don't be afraid to ask questions about the item's authenticity and provenance. Second, be prepared to spend some money. While there are plenty of affordable items out there, the most valuable pieces can cost millions of dollars. Finally, collect what you love. Whether it's a signed baseball or a game-used jersey, make sure the item holds personal significance for you.</p><h4>Tips for Avoiding Scams</h4><p>Unfortunately, the world of sports memorabilia collecting is also full of scams and fakes. Here are a few tips for avoiding them:</p><ul><li>Buy from reputable dealers and auction houses.</li><li>Get a certificate of authenticity from a third-party authenticator.</li><li>Be wary of items with no provenance or a suspicious history.</li><li>Do your research on the item and the seller before making a purchase.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion of As of 2017 What is the Most Expensive Piece of Sports Memorabilia Ever Sold</h2><p>The most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold is the T206 Honus Wagner card, which sold for $3.12 million in 2016.
