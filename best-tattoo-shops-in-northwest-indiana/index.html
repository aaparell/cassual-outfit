Most shops charge by the hour, with rates ranging from $100-$200 per hour. It's important to remember that a good tattoo is an investment, and it's worth paying a little extra to ensure that you get a high-quality piece of artwork that you'll be proud to wear for years to come.</p><p><b>Q: </b>Do I need to make an appointment to get a tattoo in Northwest Indiana?<br><b>A:</b> It's always a good idea to call ahead and make an appointment at the shop you're interested in.
