Start by buying fewer clothes and choosing pieces that are high-quality, versatile, and timeless. Look for second-hand or vintage clothing, which reduces demand for new clothing and promotes reuse.

Finally, take care of your clothes by washing them less frequently and properly disposing of them when they're no longer wearable.</p><p><h2>What are some other ethical clothing brands?</h2></p><p>Some other ethical clothing brands include People Tree, Thought, Veja, and Christy Dawn.
