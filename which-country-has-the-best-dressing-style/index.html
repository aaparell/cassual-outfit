From Hollywood to the music industry, Italian fashion has been worn by some of the most influential people in the world. The iconic little black dress by Gianni Versace, worn by Elizabeth Hurley in 1994, is still talked about today and is considered one of the most memorable fashion moments in history.</p><p><h4>How to Incorporate Italian Fashion into Your Wardrobe</h4></p><p>If you want to incorporate Italian fashion into your wardrobe, invest in timeless pieces that will last a lifetime.
