It is not flashy or ostentatious, but rather a reflection of the state's values of hard work, honesty, and integrity.</p><p><h3>The Evolution of the Traditional Dress of Bihar</h3></p><p>The dhoti-kurta has been worn in Bihar for centuries, but it has undergone several changes over time. In the past, the dhoti was made of cotton or silk and was often decorated with intricate designs or embroidery. The kurta was also made of cotton or silk and was typically worn in white or other light colors.</p><p>Today, the dhoti-kurta is still popular in Bihar, but it has been adapted to suit modern tastes and styles. The dhoti may be made of different fabrics or colors, and the kurta may be embellished with embroidery or other decorations.</p><p><h4>How to Wear the Traditional Dress of Bihar</h4></p><p>If you're interested in wearing the traditional dress of Bihar, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure that you choose the right size and fit for your body type. The dhoti should be draped tightly around the waist and legs, while the kurta should fit comfortably around the chest and arms.</p><p>Next, choose the right colors and fabrics for the occasion.
