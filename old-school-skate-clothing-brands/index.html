Their clothing was unlike anything else I had seen, and I loved the way it made me feel - like I was part of a community of skaters who didn't care about the mainstream.</p><p><h3>Santa Cruz: A California Classic</h3></p><p>Santa Cruz is a California-based skateboarding company that's been around since the 1970s. They're known for their bold, colorful designs and their commitment to quality. Santa Cruz offers a wide range of clothing, from t-shirts and hoodies to socks and hats.</p><p>One of my favorite things about Santa Cruz is their commitment to sustainability. They use eco-friendly materials whenever possible and are always looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact. Plus, their clothing is super comfortable and looks great on and off the skateboard.</p><p><h4>Powell Peralta: A Skateboarding Legacy</h4></p><p>Powell Peralta is another old school skate clothing brand with a rich history. Founded in the 1970s, Powell Peralta was one of the first companies to make skateboard decks out of durable, high-quality materials. Today, they offer a wide range of clothing and accessories, all designed with skaters in mind.</p><p>One of the things I love about Powell Peralta is their commitment to innovation. They're always experimenting with new materials and designs, and their clothing reflects this.
