Many people assume that wearing underwear under compression shorts can solve this problem, but it may not be the best solution.</p><p>The short answer is that wearing underwear under compression shorts is a personal choice.

It is important to find what works best for you and your needs.</p><p><h3>How to Prevent Chafing When Wearing Compression Shorts</h3></p><p>Chafing can be a common problem when wearing compression shorts, especially in the groin area.

Here are some tips to keep your compression shorts in good condition:</p><p><ul><li>Wash them in cold water and hang them to dry</li><li>Avoid using fabric softener or bleach, as it can damage the fibers</li><li>Do not dry them in a dryer, as the heat can damage the elastic</li><li>Store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight</li></ul></p><p><h2>My Personal Experience</h2></p><p>As someone who wears compression shorts frequently, I have experimented with wearing them with and without underwear.
