Do you want to know more about the culture and fashion of this beautiful South Indian state? Look no further, as this blog post will guide you through what is the dress of Kerala and its significance in the local lifestyle.</p><p>If you are planning to visit Kerala or attend a traditional event, it can be daunting to choose the right attire. You may be wondering what is the dress of Kerala, what are the different types of clothing, and how to wear them properly. Moreover, if you are not from India or familiar with the regional customs, you may feel unsure about the appropriateness of your outfit or worried about committing a cultural faux pas.</p><p>The dress of Kerala is a reflection of the state's rich heritage and diverse communities. The traditional attire for men is called mundu, which is a white or cream-colored cloth that is draped around the waist and legs, resembling a long skirt. Women wear a similar garment called settu mundu or mundum neriyathum, which is a two-piece garment consisting of a skirt and a shawl draped over the upper body. The shawl can be worn in different styles depending on the occasion and personal preference.</p><p>In addition to the mundu and settu mundu, Kerala has several other traditional garments that are popular among locals and tourists alike. For example, the kasavu saree is a famous saree that features a golden border and is typically worn by brides, while the thorthu is a cotton towel that is used for drying the body or as a casual garment.</p><h2>My Experience with the Dress of Kerala</h2><p>As a non-native resident of Kerala, I was initially hesitant to wear the traditional dress. However, I soon realized that it was not only a way to show respect for the local culture but also a comfortable and elegant outfit. I remember attending a wedding where all the women were wearing settu mundu, and I felt left out in my western clothes. The next time I had the chance, I bought a beautiful cotton mundum neriyathum and learned how to drape the shawl properly. Since then, I have worn it to several occasions and received many compliments from locals who appreciate my efforts to embrace their traditions.</p><h2>How to Wear the Dress of Kerala</h2><p>If you want to try the traditional dress of Kerala, there are several things to keep in mind. Firstly, choose the right fabric and color for the occasion. While white is the most common color for mundu and settu mundu, you can also opt for pastel shades or vibrant hues, depending on your taste and the event's theme. Secondly, learn how to drape the garment correctly. There are several tutorials available online or you can ask a local tailor or friend to show you. Thirdly, accessorize appropriately with jewelry, footwear, and hair ornaments. For example, a simple gold chain or bangle can complement the kasavu saree, while a jasmine garland can adorn the hair.</p><h3>Significance of the Dress of Kerala</h3><p>The dress of Kerala is not just a piece of clothing but a symbol of the state's identity and values. The mundu and settu mundu, for instance, represent simplicity, purity, and elegance, which are the core principles of Kerala's lifestyle. Moreover, the use of natural fibers such as cotton and silk reflects the state's eco-friendly and sustainable approach to fashion. By wearing the dress of Kerala, you are not only showcasing your fashion sense but also honoring the local culture and contributing to the preservation of its traditions.</p><h4>Tips for Maintaining the Dress of Kerala</h4><p>If you want to keep your mundu or settu mundu in good condition, here are some tips to follow:</p><ul><li>Wash them separately from other clothes to avoid color bleeding or shrinking</li><li>Use mild detergent and lukewarm water to prevent damage to the fabric</li><li>Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach as they can damage the golden border or embroidery</li><li>Iron the garments on a low heat setting and avoid direct heat on the border or shawl</li><li>Store them in a dry and cool place, away from sunlight or moisture</li></ul><h2>FAQs about the Dress of Kerala</h2><p>Here are some common questions and answers related to what is the dress of Kerala:</p><p><strong>Q: Can men wear kasavu saree?</strong></p><p>A: No, kasavu saree is exclusively for women, particularly brides and bridesmaids.</p><p><strong>Q: Is the dress of Kerala only for special occasions?</strong></p><p>A: No, you can wear mundu, settu mundu, or other traditional garments as casual or daily wear as well.</p><p><strong>Q: What kind of jewelry goes with mundu?</strong></p><p>A: Men usually wear a simple gold chain or bracelet, while women can choose from a range of options such as necklace, earrings, bangles, or anklets.</p><p><strong>Q: Are there any regional variations in the dress of Kerala?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, each community or district has its own style and pattern of clothing, such as the kasavu mundu of Thrissur or the kara mundu of Malabar.</p><h2>Conclusion of What is the Dress of Kerala</h2><p>The dress of Kerala is a fascinating aspect of the state's culture and fashion. Whether you are a resident or a visitor, wearing the traditional dress can be a rewarding and enriching experience that showcases your respect for the local customs and values.
