In this blog post, we will be taking a look at the top 10 biggest boxing matches of all time, and why they are so important for boxing fans.</p><p>When it comes to boxing, there are a few pain points that fans tend to experience. These include not being able to watch the biggest fights due to location or time zone differences, and not knowing which fights are worth watching.

Whether you are a die-hard fan or a newcomer to the sport, this post has something for everyone.</p><h2>1. Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier III (1975)</h2><p>I remember watching this fight with my dad when I was a kid. It was one of the most intense boxing matches I had ever seen. The two fighters were evenly matched, and the fight went the distance. In the end, Frazier won by decision, but it was a close call. This fight is significant because it was the third and final meeting between Ali and Frazier, and it took place during the height of their rivalry.</p><h2>2. Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns (1981)</h2><p>This fight is often referred to as "The Showdown." It was a highly anticipated matchup between two of the best fighters of their generation. Leonard and Hearns went toe-to-toe for 14 rounds, and the fight was ultimately stopped in the 14th round when Leonard landed a series of devastating punches on Hearns. This fight is significant because it showcased the skill and athleticism of both fighters, and it is widely considered to be one of the best fights in boxing history.</p><h2>3. Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield II (1997)</h2><p>This fight is infamous for the fact that Tyson bit off a piece of Holyfield's ear in the third round. Despite the controversy, this fight was one of the most highly anticipated matchups of the 90s. Holyfield ultimately won by disqualification, but the fight is significant because it cemented Holyfield's status as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time.</p><h3>4. Jack Dempsey vs. Gene Tunney II (1927)</h3><p>This fight was the rematch between Dempsey and Tunney, and it was one of the biggest fights of the 1920s. The two fighters were evenly matched, and the fight went the distance. In the end, Tunney was declared the winner by decision.

Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling II (1938)</h2><p>This fight was significant because it took place during a time of political tension between the United States and Germany.

Louis ultimately won the fight, which was seen as a victory for the United States over Germany.</p><h2>7. George Foreman vs. Muhammad Ali (1974)</h2><p>This fight is often referred to as "The Rumble in the Jungle."

Foreman was the heavy favorite going into the fight, but Ali shocked the world by knocking Foreman out in the eighth round. This fight is significant because it showcased Ali's incredible skill and resilience.</p><h3>8. Rocky Marciano vs. Jersey Joe Walcott II (1953)</h3><p>This fight was the rematch between Marciano and Walcott, and it was one of the most exciting fights of the 1950s. Marciano was losing on points going into the 13th round, but he landed a devastating right hand that knocked Walcott out cold. This fight is significant because it cemented Marciano's status as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time.</p><h4>9. Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Meldrick Taylor I (1990)</h4><p>This fight was one of the most controversial fights in boxing history. Chavez and Taylor were both undefeated going into the fight, and they went toe-to-toe for 12 rounds. In the final seconds of the fight, Chavez landed a series of devastating punches that left Taylor slumped against the ropes. The fight was stopped with just two seconds left on the clock, and Chavez was declared the winner by TKO. This fight is significant because it was a controversial ending to an otherwise thrilling fight.</p><h2>10.
