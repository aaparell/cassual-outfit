Research the Company</h3></p><p>Before deciding on what to wear, research the company's culture and dress code.

If you're still unsure, reach out to the interviewer or HR representative to ask about the dress code.</p><p><h3>2. Dress for the Role</h3></p><p>Your outfit should reflect the position you're applying for. If you're applying for a managerial role, wear a blazer or suit jacket. If you're applying for a more creative role, you can be a bit more casual, but still professional.</p><p><h3>3. Pay Attention to Details</h3></p><p>Details matter, so make sure your clothes are clean, ironed, and fit well. Your shoes should be polished, and your accessories should be minimal. Avoid loud prints or logos and stick to neutral colors.</p><p><h3>4. Be Comfortable</h3></p><p>You want to be comfortable in your outfit, so you can focus on the interview rather than your clothes.
