<meta name="description" content="Big Boxing Fights Coming Up Uk ImageFootballBoxing has always been a popular sport, with millions of fans around the world. And now, with some of the most anticipated fights of the year coming up, the excitement is at an all-time high. But with so many big boxing fights coming soon, it can be overwhelming to keep track of them all. In this guide, we&#39;ll take a closer look at the upcoming fights and what you can expect from them.As a boxing fan, you know that there&#39;s nothing quite like the thrill of watching two skilled boxers go head-to-head in the ring. But with so many big fights coming up, it can be difficult to decide which ones to watch and which ones to skip. Whether you&#39;re a hardcore fan or just tuning in for the first time, we&#39;ve got you covered.Let&#39;s take a closer look at the biggest boxing fights coming soon and what you can expect from them.The Fight of the Year: Canelo vs. SaundersOne of the most highly anticipated fights of the year is the showdown between Canelo Alvarez and Billy Joe Saunders. Canelo is widely regarded as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world, while Saunders is a talented British fighter with an undefeated record. This fight is scheduled to take place on May 8th, and it promises to be an absolute barnburner.As someone who has been following boxing for years, I can tell you that this fight has all the makings of a classic. Both fighters are incredibly skilled, and they have very different styles that should make for an entertaining matchup. Canelo is known for his power and aggressiveness, while Saunders is more of a slick and elusive fighter.The Heavyweight Showdown: Joshua vs. FuryAnother fight that has boxing fans buzzing is the long-awaited matchup between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury. This fight has been in the works for years, and it finally looks like it&#39;s going to happen this summer. Both fighters are heavyweight champions with impressive records, and this fight will determine who the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world is.Personally, I can&#39;t wait for this fight. It&#39;s not often that we get to see two heavyweight champions go head-to-head, and this one has the potential to be an all-time classic. Joshua is known for his power and technical skill, while Fury is a master of defense and counterpunching. It&#39;s going to be a fascinating matchup.The Rise of Ryan GarciaRyan Garcia is quickly becoming one of the biggest stars in boxing, and for good reason. The young fighter has an undefeated record and a ton of charisma, and he&#39;s quickly becoming a fan favorite. While he doesn&#39;t have a fight scheduled just yet, there are rumors that he could be taking on Manny Pacquiao in the near future.If you haven&#39;t seen Ryan Garcia fight yet, I highly recommend checking out some of his previous fights. He&#39;s an incredibly talented fighter with a bright future ahead of him.How to Watch the Big Boxing Fights Coming SoonIf you&#39;re looking to watch the big boxing fights coming up, there are a few different options available.

Both fighters are incredibly skilled, and they have very different styles that should make for an entertaining matchup. Canelo is known for his power and aggressiveness, while Saunders is more of a slick and elusive fighter.</p><p><h2>The Heavyweight Showdown: Joshua vs. Fury</h2></p><p>Another fight that has boxing fans buzzing is the long-awaited matchup between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury. This fight has been in the works for years, and it finally looks like it's going to happen this summer. Both fighters are heavyweight champions with impressive records, and this fight will determine who the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world is.</p><p>Personally, I can't wait for this fight. It's not often that we get to see two heavyweight champions go head-to-head, and this one has the potential to be an all-time classic. Joshua is known for his power and technical skill, while Fury is a master of defense and counterpunching. It's going to be a fascinating matchup.</p><p><h3>The Rise of Ryan Garcia</h3></p><p>Ryan Garcia is quickly becoming one of the biggest stars in boxing, and for good reason. The young fighter has an undefeated record and a ton of charisma, and he's quickly becoming a fan favorite. While he doesn't have a fight scheduled just yet, there are rumors that he could be taking on Manny Pacquiao in the near future.</p><p>If you haven't seen Ryan Garcia fight yet, I highly recommend checking out some of his previous fights. He's an incredibly talented fighter with a bright future ahead of him.</p><p><h4>How to Watch the Big Boxing Fights Coming Soon</h4></p><p>If you're looking to watch the big boxing fights coming up, there are a few different options available.

Some fights may also be available on streaming services like DAZN or ESPN+.</p><p>Before you order a fight, be sure to check the start time and the price. Some fights may start very late at night due to the time difference, and the cost can vary depending on the provider.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Big Boxing Fights Coming</h2></p><p>There's no denying that boxing is one of the most exciting sports out there, and with so many big fights coming up, it's a great time to be a fan.
