He has an impressive record of 30 wins, 0 losses, and 1 draw. Fury is known for his unorthodox style and his ability to move around the ring with ease.

However, he had to relinquish his titles due to personal issues, which led to a hiatus from boxing. He made his comeback in 2018 and has since won all of his fights, including a highly anticipated rematch against Deontay Wilder in February 2020. </p><h2>Anthony Joshua: The Unified Heavyweight Champion</h2><p>Anthony Joshua is a British boxer who currently holds the WBA, IBF, and WBO heavyweight titles.
