Here's how to make it:</p><p>Ingredients:</p><ul><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li><li>1 pound ground beef</li><li>1 pound Italian sausage</li><li>1 large onion, chopped</li><li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>2 cans (28 oz. each) crushed tomatoes</li><li>1 can (6 oz.) tomato paste</li><li>2 teaspoons salt</li><li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li><li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li><li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li><li>1 teaspoon sugar</li><li>1/2 cup red wine</li></ul><p>Directions:</p><ol><li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, Italian sausage, onion, and garlic. Cook until the meat is browned and the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes.</li><li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, basil, oregano, sugar, and red wine.

This includes fresh herbs, garlic, and onions. Using fresh ingredients will give your sauce a brighter, more vibrant flavor.</p><p><h4>Cook the Sauce Low and Slow</h4></p><p>The key to a great lasagna sauce is to cook it low and slow. This allows the flavors to meld together and intensify. It's also important to stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from burning on the bottom of the pot.</p><p><h2>Variations on Authentic Italian Lasagna Sauce</h2></p><p>While the recipe above is a classic version of authentic Italian lasagna sauce, there are many variations you can try. For example, you can add mushrooms, bell peppers, or even a splash of balsamic vinegar to give your sauce a unique twist.

You can also freeze the sauce for up to three months.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I make this sauce vegetarian?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can omit the ground beef and Italian sausage and use a meatless substitute, such as crumbled tofu or tempeh.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use fresh tomatoes instead of canned?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can use fresh tomatoes instead of canned, but you will need to peel and seed them first. This can be a bit time-consuming, but it will give your sauce a fresher, brighter flavor.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use this sauce for other dishes besides lasagna?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! This sauce is versatile and can be used for a variety of dishes, such as spaghetti, pizza, or even as a dipping sauce for bread.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Authentic Italian Lasagna Sauce</h2></p><p>Making authentic Italian lasagna sauce may seem intimidating, but with the right ingredients and a little bit of patience, you can create a rich, flavorful sauce that will take your homemade lasagna to the next level.
