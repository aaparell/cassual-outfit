It has a rich mythology, including stories of the gods and goddesses that were worshipped at the time. Thirdly, the caste system was a social hierarchy that divided people into different groups based on their occupation and birth. It was a complex system that played a significant role in Indian society for centuries.</p><h2>Summarizing the Main Points</h2><p>Ancient India is a fascinating subject that encompasses many different topics.
