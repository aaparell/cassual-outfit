Shopping for vintage clothing online can be even more challenging, as you can't try the pieces on and there's always a risk of receiving something that's not as described or pictured. However, there are some amazing vintage clothing online shops out there that offer a wide range of styles and sizes, as well as affordable prices and excellent customer service.</p><p>If you're someone who loves vintage clothing but doesn't have the time or patience to scour thrift stores and flea markets, shopping online is a great option. However, with so many vintage clothing online shops to choose from, it can be overwhelming to know where to start.</p><p>In this article, we'll introduce you to some of the best vintage clothing online shops and help you find the perfect pieces to add to your wardrobe.</p><p><h2>The Best Vintage Clothing Online Shops and Where to Find Them</h2></p><p>1. <b>ASOS Marketplace</b> - With over 800 boutiques selling vintage and retro clothing, ASOS Marketplace is a great place to start your search. You'll find everything from vintage Levi's jeans to 90s grunge dresses, all at reasonable prices.</p><p>I recently purchased a vintage Hawaiian shirt from ASOS Marketplace and was impressed by the quality and fast shipping. The seller also included a handwritten note and a discount code for my next purchase.</p><p>2. <b>Depop</b> - Depop is a social shopping app that allows users to buy and sell vintage and secondhand clothing. You can follow your favorite sellers and search for specific items or brands.</p><p>As someone who loves 80s and 90s fashion, Depop is a treasure trove of vintage finds. I recently scored a vintage Tommy Hilfiger cropped sweater for a fraction of the retail price.</p><p>3. <b>The RealReal</b> - If you're looking for high-end vintage pieces, The RealReal is the place to go. They specialize in luxury consignment and offer a wide range of designer clothing, shoes, and accessories.</p><p>While The RealReal can be on the pricier side, the quality and authenticity of their pieces are guaranteed. I recently purchased a vintage Chanel crossbody bag from The RealReal and was thrilled with the condition and packaging.</p><p><h3>What to Look for When Shopping for Vintage Clothing Online</h3></p><p>When shopping for vintage clothing online, it's important to keep a few things in mind:</p><p>- Check the measurements: Vintage clothing can run smaller than modern sizes, so always check the measurements before purchasing.</p><p>- Look for flaws: Vintage clothing is often pre-worn and may have some wear and tear. Look for descriptions or photos that show any flaws or damage.</p><p>- Read reviews: If you're buying from a marketplace or independent seller, read reviews from previous buyers to ensure a positive experience.</p><p>- Check return policies: Make sure the seller has a clear return policy in case the item doesn't fit or isn't as described.</p><p><h4>Tips for Styling Vintage Clothing</h4></p><p>Once you've found the perfect vintage pieces, it's time to style them in a modern way:</p><p>- Mix vintage with modern: Don't be afraid to mix vintage pieces with modern ones for a unique look. Pair a vintage blouse with high-waisted jeans or a vintage skirt with a graphic t-shirt.</p><p>- Accessorize: Add modern accessories like statement jewelry or a trendy handbag to balance out the vintage feel.</p><p>- Tailor if necessary: If a vintage piece doesn't fit quite right, consider taking it to a tailor to get it altered.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q:</b> Are vintage clothing online shops more expensive than brick and mortar stores?</p><p><b>A:</b> Not necessarily. While some vintage clothing online shops may be more expensive, there are plenty of affordable options as well. Plus, shopping online allows you to compare prices and find the best deals.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Is it safe to buy vintage clothing online?</p><p><b>A:</b> Shopping for vintage clothing online can be safe as long as you do your research and buy from reputable sellers. Look for clear return policies and read reviews from previous buyers.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can vintage clothing be worn year-round?</p><p><b>A:</b> Absolutely! Vintage clothing can be worn year-round with the right styling. Try layering a vintage sweater over a dress in the winter or wearing a vintage floral dress with sandals in the summer.</p><p><b>Q:</b> How do I know if a vintage piece is authentic?</p><p><b>A:</b> Authentic vintage pieces may have tags or labels that indicate the brand or era. Do your research and look for details like fabric types, zippers, and buttons that are indicative of the time period.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Vintage Clothing Online Shops</h2></p><p>Shopping for vintage clothing online can be a fun and rewarding experience, as long as you know where to look and what to look for. By shopping at reputable vintage clothing online shops like ASOS Marketplace, Depop, and The RealReal, you can find unique and affordable pieces to add to your wardrobe. Remember to check measurements, read reviews, and look for flaws before making a purchase. With a little bit of research and styling, vintage clothing can be a great addition to any modern wardrobe.</p></article>
