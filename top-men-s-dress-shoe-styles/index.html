<meta name="description" content="11 Best Shoes for Men 2017 Mens Formal Dress Shoes, Leather WingtipsAre you tired of feeling like you&#39;re not putting your best foot forward? Do you want to improve your professional image? Investing in a quality pair of men&#39;s dress shoes can make a world of difference. But with so many styles out there, it can be overwhelming to know where to start.That&#39;s where this guide comes in. We&#39;ll break down the top men&#39;s dress shoe styles and help you find the perfect pair for your needs.When it comes to dress shoes, the main goal is to look polished and put-together. You want a shoe that complements your outfit and shows that you pay attention to the details. The right pair of dress shoes can elevate any look, whether you&#39;re wearing a suit for a job interview or dressing up for a wedding.In this guide, we&#39;ll cover the most popular men&#39;s dress shoe styles, including oxfords, loafers, brogues, and more. We&#39;ll also provide tips on how to choose the right style for your needs and how to care for your shoes to make them last.OxfordsOxfords are a classic dress shoe style that never goes out of fashion. They feature a closed lacing system, meaning the shoelace eyelets are sewn underneath the vamp (the front part of the shoe). This gives them a sleek, streamlined appearance that&#39;s perfect for formal occasions.Personally, I love wearing oxfords to job interviews or important meetings. They give me the confidence I need to present myself well and make a good impression.LoafersIf you&#39;re looking for a more casual dress shoe style, loafers are a great option. They&#39;re slip-on shoes that don&#39;t have laces, making them easy to put on and take off. However, they still look sharp and dressy, thanks to their sleek silhouette.One of my favorite ways to wear loafers is with chinos and a blazer. It&#39;s a comfortable yet stylish outfit that&#39;s perfect for a night out or a casual work function.BroguesBrogues are a dress shoe style that features decorative perforations (called &#34;broguing&#34;) on the leather upper. They were originally designed as outdoor shoes, but over time they&#39;ve become a popular choice for formal occasions as well.I like wearing brogues when I want to add a little bit of personality to my outfit. They&#39;re perfect for weddings or other events where you want to look sharp but still have a bit of fun with your outfit.How to Choose the Right Dress Shoe StyleWhen choosing a dress shoe style, it&#39;s important to consider your needs and the occasion. Are you looking for a shoe to wear to work every day, or do you need something for a special event? Do you want a classic style that will never go out of fashion, or something more trendy?It&#39;s also important to consider the fit and comfort of the shoe. Make sure to try on shoes before buying them and walk around in them to ensure they feel comfortable and don&#39;t pinch or rub anywhere.ConclusionInvesting in a quality pair of men&#39;s dress shoes can make a big difference in your professional image. Whether you choose classic oxfords, stylish loafers, or decorative brogues, there&#39;s a dress shoe style out there for everyone. Just remember to consider your needs and the occasion when choosing a style, and take care of your shoes to ensure they last for years to come.Question and AnswerQ: What color dress shoe should I choose?A: Black and brown are the most versatile colors for dress shoes.

Do you want to improve your professional image? Investing in a quality pair of men's dress shoes can make a world of difference. But with so many styles out there, it can be overwhelming to know where to start.</p><p>That's where this guide comes in. We'll break down the top men's dress shoe styles and help you find the perfect pair for your needs.</p><p>When it comes to dress shoes, the main goal is to look polished and put-together. You want a shoe that complements your outfit and shows that you pay attention to the details. The right pair of dress shoes can elevate any look, whether you're wearing a suit for a job interview or dressing up for a wedding.</p><p>In this guide, we'll cover the most popular men's dress shoe styles, including oxfords, loafers, brogues, and more. We'll also provide tips on how to choose the right style for your needs and how to care for your shoes to make them last.</p><p><h2>Oxfords</h2></p><p>Oxfords are a classic dress shoe style that never goes out of fashion. They feature a closed lacing system, meaning the shoelace eyelets are sewn underneath the vamp (the front part of the shoe). This gives them a sleek, streamlined appearance that's perfect for formal occasions.</p><p>Personally, I love wearing oxfords to job interviews or important meetings. They give me the confidence I need to present myself well and make a good impression.</p><p><h2>Loafers</h2></p><p>If you're looking for a more casual dress shoe style, loafers are a great option. They're slip-on shoes that don't have laces, making them easy to put on and take off. However, they still look sharp and dressy, thanks to their sleek silhouette.</p><p>One of my favorite ways to wear loafers is with chinos and a blazer. It's a comfortable yet stylish outfit that's perfect for a night out or a casual work function.</p><p><h3>Brogues</h3></p><p>Brogues are a dress shoe style that features decorative perforations (called "broguing") on the leather upper. They were originally designed as outdoor shoes, but over time they've become a popular choice for formal occasions as well.</p><p>I like wearing brogues when I want to add a little bit of personality to my outfit. They're perfect for weddings or other events where you want to look sharp but still have a bit of fun with your outfit.</p><p><h4>How to Choose the Right Dress Shoe Style</h4></p><p>When choosing a dress shoe style, it's important to consider your needs and the occasion. Are you looking for a shoe to wear to work every day, or do you need something for a special event? Do you want a classic style that will never go out of fashion, or something more trendy?</p><p>It's also important to consider the fit and comfort of the shoe. Make sure to try on shoes before buying them and walk around in them to ensure they feel comfortable and don't pinch or rub anywhere.</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>Investing in a quality pair of men's dress shoes can make a big difference in your professional image. Whether you choose classic oxfords, stylish loafers, or decorative brogues, there's a dress shoe style out there for everyone. Just remember to consider your needs and the occasion when choosing a style, and take care of your shoes to ensure they last for years to come.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: What color dress shoe should I choose?</strong></p><p>A: Black and brown are the most versatile colors for dress shoes. Choose black for more formal occasions and brown for a more casual look.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear dress shoes with jeans?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, but make sure to choose a more casual dress shoe style like loafers or brogues. Avoid wearing oxfords with jeans, as they're too formal for this type of outfit.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I care for my dress shoes?</strong></p><p>A: Make sure to regularly clean and polish your dress shoes to keep them looking their best. Use a shoe tree to help maintain their shape and prevent creasing.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear dress shoes without socks?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, but make sure to choose a no-show sock or footie to keep your feet comfortable and prevent odors.</p></article>
